My flake-based NixOS config.
The following is just some instructions for me to use when dealing with rebuilds and updates.

* Rebuild
Before committing, run a dry build to make sure everything will work as expected.
#+begin_src sh
nixos-rebuild dry-build
#+end_src

After committing, run a rebuild to put the config into effect.
#+begin_src sh
nixos-rebuild switch
#+end_src

* Updates
To update a particular input to its latest revision, run the following at the root of the repo.
#+begin_src sh
nix flake update --update-input nixpkgs
#+end_src

To update all inputs to their latest revisions:
#+begin_src sh
nix flake update
#+end_src
